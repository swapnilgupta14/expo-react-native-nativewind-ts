   ```

## üîÑ Workflow

### Development Workflow:

1. **Create feature branch** from `develop`

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request** to `develop`

   - Go to GitHub and create PR from your feature branch to `develop`
   - Fill out the PR template
   - CI checks will run automatically

4. **Review and Merge**
   - `swapnilgupta14` must approve the PR
   - All CI checks must pass
   - PR gets merged to `develop`

### Release Workflow:

1. **Create release PR** from `develop` to `main`

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
   # Update version in package.json
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.0.0"
   git push origin release/v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request** to `main`

   - PR from `develop` to `main`
   - `swapnilgupta14` must approve
   - All checks must pass

3. **Merge to main triggers release**
   - Android APK build and release
   - iOS build and release
   - Web deployment to Vercel
   - GitHub release created automatically

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CI checks failing:**

   - Check that all linting passes: `bun run lint`
   - Check that formatting is correct: `bun run format:check`
   - Check that tests pass: `bun run test`

2. **Build failures:**

   - Verify Expo token is correct
   - Check that app.json is properly configured
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

3. **Vercel deployment issues:**
   - Verify Vercel tokens are correct
   - Check that vercel.json is properly configured
   - Ensure build command works locally

### Local Testing:

```bash
# Test CI checks locally
bun run lint
bun run format:check
bun run test

# Test build locally
bun run expo export --platform web
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify all secrets are correctly configured
3. Test the build process locally first
